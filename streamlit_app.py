# Introduction
The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) is an initiative that aims to create a comprehensive multi-scale spatial atlas of the healthy human body. HuBMAP aims to help biomedical researchers visualize how the cells in the human body influence our health and can also help others understand the way in which the human body functions. HuBMAP can only finalize its atlas with the help of data providers, data curators and other contributors. 

Data providers are crucial to HuBMAP, these providers are responsible for producing biological data from various tissues of donors. These tissues are utilized by different types of cutting-edge technologies such as, single cell transcriptomics, bulk tissue arrays, etc. These providers generate high-quality datasets that help form a structure for HuBMAP.

Additionally, HIVE — the HuBMAP Integration, Visualization, and Engagement team holds the responsibility of curating, integrating, and standardizing the vast amount of datasets. HIVE ensures that the datasets meet quality standards before they become publicly available. HIVE also helps develop analytical tools for scientific researchers to understand and utilize the datasets.

With all the data provided and curated, contributors then develop innovative tools that enhance data analysis and help transform the data into the atlas. Contributions come from 42 different sites, 14 states, and 4 countries. With these contributions, HuBMAP is able to advance its technological and scientific capabilities.

Through the seamless integration of work from data providers, contributors, and HIVE, HuBMAP strives to create a high-tech transformational atlas that fosters inventions of new discoveries in the field of biomedical research.
